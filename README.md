# Marten - document database and event store 

Document databases became popular in last years. They have a lot of places where they are suitable to use. MongoDb, RavenDb are doing very well on production sites. This time I`ll tell something about Marten which has feature of document database and event store. The new thing is that Marten works on the top of Postgres database.

## What is it Marten?

I`ve heard the first time about Marten on Slack channel when some person shared the link to [this post](https://jeremydmiller.com/2016/08/18/moving-from-ravendb-to-marten/). [Jeremy Miller](https://jeremydmiller.com/) shows why his team decided to abandon RavenDb and setup completly new project with utilizing Postgres relational database.
